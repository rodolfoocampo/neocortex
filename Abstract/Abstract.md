This thesis investigates how to enable effective co-creativity with generative artificial intelligence (AI). Generative AI has recently exploded in popularity, and it is being adopted across a wide range of activities, with creative domains being a particular locus of disruption. While much research has focused on advancing generative AIâ€™s technical capabilities, relatively little attention has been given to how humans can interact effectively with these systems. Consequently, there is a gap in design principles guiding the development of generative AI systems that can effectively foster co-creativity.

This research addresses three primary questions:

1. How can human-AI co-creativity be enabled?

2. What design principles support effective co-creativity with generative AI tools?

3. What roles can AI play in creative processes, and how do these roles influence system design?

  
To explore these questions, I adopted a mixed-methods approach combining practice-based research and empirical user studies, focusing on three creative domains: new media art installations, image generation, and writing.


The findings reveal a spectrum of roles that AI can assume in creative processes, both emergent and explicitly designed. This thesis identifies a set of design principles that enhance human-AI co-creativity and demonstrates how these principles can be adapted based on the specific roles assigned to AI. These insights contribute to the development of generative AI systems that effectively support collaborative creativity.
