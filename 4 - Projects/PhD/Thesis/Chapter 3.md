## Elements of dialogic interaction 

There are a few elements that can comprise dialogic interaction. 
- Autonomous generation 
	- From text
	- Random sampling
	- Any other command
- Two-way communication
	- Goal setting
	- Meta communication (for example, prompting is not meta communication)
	- Mechanisms for repair
	- Pushback and active questioning by the computer
- Context awareness 
	- Past interactions
	- Sociocultural awareness
	- Access to user preferences 
- Workspace embeddedness
	- Can read and modify items within the workspace. For example, a codebase, or in the case of a writing assistant, file system, other writing. (Is this different from context awareness)
- Shared space and shared artifact
	- Both user and AI share a space to act and read the live artifact. 
	- How is this different from the above? You may not need access to a whole workspace to have this. For example, ChatGPT Canvas, Common AI.
- Iteration and feedback mechanism
	- Consistency
	- Non-destructive edits

## Levels of co-creativity

The levels of co-creativity correspond to levels of increasing dialogic collaboration. Those elements are not only dialogic in nature, but also the literature and my research shows they are related to more effective collaboration. 

The higher the level, the more elements it has. The fifth levels contains all of them. The first one only the generative aspect. 

In this scale, new elements are introduced in new levels. For example, the shared space is introduced in the third. The sociocultural preference embeddedness is introduced in the fifth. However, you can have a generative (level 1) system that has the element of embededness (level 5). You can have different combinations and one is not strictly dependent on others. 
This scale seeks to provide a logical linear flow, primarily inspired by how the technology has progressed. It is encouraged for designers to explore also combinations of these elements, implemented in various forms, without this necessarily implying a rigid scale. 

For some applications, some elements are more important, and the designers might choose to implement one over the other. However, ultimately, this scale does propose that the highest level of an embedded collaborative co-creator will include all of these elements. But in the scale between the most basic and this full level, there are many possible combinations. 

## Level 1: Generative

Autonomous generation 

## Level 2: Iterative

Iteration and feedback

## Level 3: Communicative

Two way communication

## Level 4: Collaborative

Shared artifact and workspace

## Level 4: Embedded

 Context awareness 
	- Past interactions
	- Sociocultural awareness
	- Access to user preferences 
- Workspace embeddedness
	- Can read and modify items within the workspace. For example, a codebase, or in the case of a writing assistant, file system, other writing. (Is this different from context awareness)
