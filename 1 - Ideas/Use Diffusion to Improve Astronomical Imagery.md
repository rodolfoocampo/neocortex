Diffusion models denoise images, essentially taking a low-resolution image to a higher resolution. This is currently used to generate images based on a prompt. However, can this be used in other applications like improving the quality of astronomical imagery? Taking a super blurry image and upscaling it? Or taking a description of a region in space? Or taking non-visible imagery?
