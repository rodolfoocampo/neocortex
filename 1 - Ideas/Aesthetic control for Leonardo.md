#Ideas/Leonardo 

It seems that the future of image generation heavily involves omnimodality (language models with native multimodal capabilities). A huge advantage of this is that they will be able to edit images directly, without making destructive edits or reprompting a separate diffusion model. 
Where does that leave image generators like Leonardo? 
What will be the value of a standalone generator in a world where language models are omnipresent and omnicapable. 
I think one of the ways in which these models can stay relevant is aesthetic differentiation. 
Large language models will have a very generic aesthetic that won't be useful for designers or people with a specific aesthetic intention. 
Models like Leonardo will stand out by enabling people to select specific aesthetics, and train their own. 
How to do this? Of course LoRas are already doing this. But we need a new word, not style or present, but aesthetic, since aesthetic is the fundamental level of operation for artists and designers, and better encapsulates what this does. 
You will be able to select premade aesthetics, similar to what Frames does, or what LoRAs do, but much more nicely curated. 
You will also be able to create a moodboard, and generate an aesthetic for that. 

This will be massive for Canva. 
Right now, in Canva you can only select from 4 styles. 
This is hugely limiting, and styles is associated negatively with stealing from other artists or plagiarsm (stealing their style). 
But aesthetics is a much more general concept, closer to vibe, which is harder to specifically pin down to a specific creator, and it is usually made of combinations of many styles and elements that create a specific aesthetic or vibe.
